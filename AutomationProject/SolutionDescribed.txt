DESIGN SOLUTION

	In the current project I chose C# language for building the project beacause it is the language that I control very well at the moment.
 NUnit was required as well for creating the automation test. Re-sharper also helps in the project by analyze the quality of the code, eliminate the
 errors, code style and formatting, debugging the solution and in the end runing the test.
 
 PROJECT DESCRIPTION
 
 For creating the automation test I created two async methods for calling the Apis. The first method calls "Shuffle the cards" Api for returning the 
 initial "remaining" count. The secound method calls "Draw a card" Api with a random number ( between 1 and 5) and with the same deck id used in
 the previous method. In the main program I created a test which is doing the required scenario, draw cards for 5 times with a random number (between 1-5) and
 the subtration to see the remaining cards in the deck at the end
 
 INSTRUCTIONS FOR RUN THE TEST
 
 1. Install NUnit package and Re-sharper tool
 2. Build the solution for checking is the build is success or not
 4. Press the right click on the green bullet point in the right side of the Main method
 
 Note: I've attached a printscreen with the results
